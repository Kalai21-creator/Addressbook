The Address Book project is a C-based application designed to help users manage and organize their contacts efficiently. This console application allows users to add, edit, delete, and search for contact information, making it a practical tool for personal or professional use. 

The main features include adding new contacts, which requires the user to input details such as name, phone number, email, and address. Each contact is stored in a structured format, typically using file handling to ensure data persistence even after the program is closed. Users can also edit existing contacts to update information as needed, and delete contacts that are no longer relevant.

Searching for contacts is streamlined, enabling users to quickly locate specific entries by name or other attributes. The project emphasizes data validation to ensure the accuracy of inputs, such as checking for valid phone numbers and email formats. Additionally, the program can list all contacts, providing an overview of the stored information.

This Address Book project serves as an excellent introduction to file handling, data structures, and user interface design in C. It helps users understand how to manage data effectively while reinforcing fundamental programming concepts. By building this application, developers gain valuable experience in creating interactive software that addresses real-world needs. Overall, the Address Book project not only enhances organizational skills but also showcases the practical application of programming in everyday tasks.

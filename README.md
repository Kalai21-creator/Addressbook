# Address Book Project Documentation

## Project Overview
The Address Book Project is a console-based application written in the C programming language. It provides functionalities to store and manage contact information such as names, telephone or mobile numbers, and email addresses. The project focuses on fundamental C programming concepts, including command-line arguments, input parsing, and file operations, without relying on Abstract Data Types (ADTs).

## Features
The application supports the following operations:

### 1. Add Contact
- **Add a new contact with username:**
  - Enter the name of the contact.
  - Provide one or more phone numbers.
  - Provide one or more email addresses.

### 2. Search Contact
- **Search by name:** Locate a contact using the name.
- **Search by phone number:** Find a contact associated with a given phone number.
- **Search by email address:** Find a contact associated with a specific email address.

### 3. Edit Contact
- **Edit by name:** Modify the contact details based on the name.
- **Edit by phone number:** Update the details associated with a phone number.
- **Edit by email address:** Change the contact information linked to an email.

### 4. Delete Contact
- **Delete by name:** Remove a contact using the name.
- **Delete by phone number:** Delete the contact linked to a given phone number.
- **Delete by email address:** Remove the contact associated with an email.

### 5. List All Contacts
- Display all stored contacts with their associated details.

### 6. Save the Address Book
- Save the address book to a file to persist the data.

### 7. Exit Application
- Safely exit the application.

## Key Concepts Utilized
This project leverages several essential features of the C programming language:

### 1. Command-Line Arguments
- Used for initializing the application or specifying data files.

### 2. Input Parsing
- Efficient handling of user input for names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

### 3. File Operations
- Read and write operations to store and retrieve contact information.

### 4. Control Structures
- Loops and conditionals to manage application logic.

## Advanced Extensions
As an advanced exercise, this project can be extended by:
- Implementing Abstract Data Types (ADTs) such as linked lists or hash tables.
- Using more sophisticated search algorithms for optimized resource usage.
- Enhancing the user interface.
- Introducing data encryption for secure storage.

## Building and Running the Project

### Compilation
To compile the project, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -o address_book address_book.c
```

### Running the Application
```bash
./address_book
```

### Sample Usage
1. Add a new contact:
   - Enter the name: "John Doe"
   - Phone number: "1234567890"
   - Email: "johndoe@example.com"

2. Search for a contact by name:
   - Enter the name: "John Doe"

3. Edit contact details:
   - Choose to edit by name, phone number, or email.

4. Delete a contact by phone number:
   - Enter the phone number: "1234567890"

5. Save and exit:
   - Select the "Save" option and confirm exit.
